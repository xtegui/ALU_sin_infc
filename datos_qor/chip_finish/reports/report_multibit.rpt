Reasons for sequential cells not mapping to multibit during RTL banking:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanations: r31a: Cell cannot be banked to multibit because it needs smaller bit width multibit cells which are not available. (Number of cells: 32)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   r4: Cell cannot be banked to multibit because it does not have multibit equivalent in the library. (Number of cells: 32)

Reasons for sequential cells not mapping to multibit during Physical Banking:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanations: pb6: Cell cannot be banked to multibit because of donâ€™t_touch restriction on it.(Number of cells: 33)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   pb19: Cell does not have multibit equivalent in the library.(Number of cells: 3)
